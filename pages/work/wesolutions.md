# Full Stack Developer at Wesual/Wesolutions GmbH

__from__ 2022 __to__ 2024

## Expirience

I was tasked with creating an account management web app that would allow our administration to deploy, manage, and remove resources, licenses, and accounts. Previously, they used a terminal for this purpose, but now they have a user-friendly progressive web app. This includes managing the main account service and deploying new microservices, which are utilized by their smart display devices for weather and other necessary services. I also built an OAuth authentication system to enable smart displays to show data from users' Facebook profiles, Google Docs, Zoho services, and Microsoft services. My responsibilities included deploying the web apps and services on an Ubuntu server, installing Nginx, creating system processes, and using Certbot

## Challange

Taking responsibility for the entire process of developing a product, testing it, and deploying it in a production-ready environment. Learning a new database like CouchDB, which I have started to appreciate. Managing an Ubuntu server and deploying web applications and services on it. Building and managing multiple microservices for external devices and internal web applications.
