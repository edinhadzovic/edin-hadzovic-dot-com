# Application Engineer at smaXtec

## Expirience

As an **Application Engineer**, my main task was to develop an alternative to **Firestore**, which had become increasingly difficult to work with. We decided to implement a **GraphQL** server using **NestJS** and **GraphQL**, allowing us to move much of our business logic from the front end to the backend.

It was a great experience building a custom **PostgreSQL** query builder and observing the resulting performance improvements. I was part of both the web and app teams. Initially, I focused on implementing web components, and later, I contributed to a major refactor of our application to migrate from **Firestore** to our new GraphQL backend.

Although the process was challenging, it was also highly educational. As the technical owner of the GraphQL service, I had full control and responsibility for its design and maintenance. I selected the technology stack and mentored team members who were new to backend development, helping them gain hands-on experience with NestJS.

**SmaXtec** is a global company with customers around the world. Working there offered valuable insight into how users from different regions use the product. It’s a truly unique solution that helps farmers monitor their animals and gain deeper insights into herd health and behavior.

## Challange

SmaXtec has multiple development teams across different departments — including hardware, data science, backend, and frontend (application). Coordinating efforts between all these teams can be challenging. Refactoring a large portion of the application from Firestore to GraphQL, while also modernizing significant parts of the React Native codebase, was a major undertaking — but also an incredibly valuable learning experience.
