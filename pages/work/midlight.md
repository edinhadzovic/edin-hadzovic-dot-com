# Junior Full Stack Developer at Midlight GmbH

__from__ 2017 __to__ 2018

## Expirience

I was a part of a team that developed the front-end for Swarovski, we use Html, Sass, and vanillaJS. We used the atomic design methodology for creating the page components. It was a great experience working on such a huge project. Taking the design and creating pixel-perfect components. I was part of developing a ticket processing API, I developed the authentication system and different GET/POST/PUT/DELETE routes for getting tickets. I was using conrect5 and a little bit of PHP for a basic hotel booking website.

I was really happy working for them, but I was ready to take on new challenges and experiences.

## Challange

This was my first experience in developing products/services for a client, and the challenge was to learn fast as possible, learning tools like JIRA, Github, code management, and working in a team to deliver a great product for the client.
