# Full Stack Developer at Denovo GmbH

## Expirience

I was a part of different teams that developed 3 different projects for the clients. We would develop the backend service ( rest API or GraphQL server ) and the front-end interfaces.  The majority of the time I was working on Battbox for Saubermacher, developing a battery trash management system where businesses can manage their trash and recycle it. I was a part of developing RecycleMich rest API, we developed authentication, messaging system, and rewards system. We developed it in a short time and was a great success with our client. The third project was again a trash container system, where businesses could order containers for moving their trash.

## Challange

Working on multiple projects, communicating with different teams, and high tempo of delivering code. Learn more about GraphQL, deploying applications with Heroku and writing simple docker-composer files.
