# Full Stack Developer at Icomedias GmbH

__from__ 2018 __to__ 2021 : __3 years__

## Expirience

This was a great workspace to work in, it was a great group of senior, mid, and junior team developers. I had the single responsibility for developing the front-end for the admin panel for the customer, managing forms, displaying data, and tools for managing privileges. I wrote tests for the backend API in typescript, we used mocha/chai to test our backend implementation and implemented a CI (continuous integration) system for our backend. If the test would fall, an email would be sent to the core developers. I used React and Sass, using Webpack to create prod/dev bundles, we used Typescript in a majority of the projects. I was a part of the team developing their smart form application and we developed that without a framework, all states and components were developed with pure Typescript and Sass. We build a custom command-line tool for our backend service, for exporting/importing forms in an excel spreadsheet.

I learned a lot from my senior developers, and we build a great product that was used by a lot of companies based in Austria/Germany and even in Australia.
